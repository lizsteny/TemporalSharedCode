# MSc thesis project

Some code for the MSc thesis project

About the project: The principal aim of this project is to identify and evaluate the genomic features of RNA viruses that are most effective for predicting virus-plant associations through different machine-learning methods. Initially, the analysis will focus on differentiating RNA viruses that infect plants from those that do not. Subsequently, the model will further identify which specific types of plants are predicted to interact with the RNA viruses that can infect plants.
