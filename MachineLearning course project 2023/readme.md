# Machine Learning Course

Final group project (week2) for the course machine learning were we compared different regression and classification models. 

About the project: This project aimed to use single-cell transcriptomics data to explore and categorise retinal neuron cells. We used a subset of the data generated by Shekhar et al. (2016).
- We retrieved a subset of single-cell transcriptomics data that comprised 452 genes across 3,700 samples in Mus musculus.
- The dataset was divided into 4 cell classes: Amacrine, Rod Bipolar, Cone Bipolar ON and Cone Bipolar OFF and 9 neuronal cell types: Amacrine, BC2, BC3A, BC3B, BC4, BC6, BC7 and Rod Bipolar.
